# CoffeeCalc
A program to calculate my pour over ratios in the morning so that I don't have to switch back and forth between a calculator and a stopwatch.

What I want to add:
    * Saving to a favorite
    * Saving multiple loadouts
    * Rating of each cup
    * Grind
    * Grinder
    * Brew method
    * Equipment brand
    * Recommended settings for a given brew method and bean
    * Water temperature
    * COFFEE TYPE (Farm as well?)
    * A way better ui
